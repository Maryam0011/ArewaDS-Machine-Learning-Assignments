# Instructions

Bots are everywhere. Your assignment: find one and adopt it! You can find them on web sites, in banking applications, and on the phone, for example when you call financial services companies for advice or account information. Analyze the bot and see if you can confuse it. If you can confuse the bot, why do you think that happened? Write a short paper about your experience.

## Title: Analyzing and Confusing Bots: A Case Study on the My AI on snapchat

### Abstract:

I give a case study on adopting and examining an AI bot on SnapChat, in order to learn more about its capabilities and determine whether it is prone to confusion. 

### Introduction:

Snapchat has introduced its AI chatbot, My AI, to users across the globe. The new feature aims to improve conversations between friends on the platform, as the chatbot can answer trivia questions, offer gift suggestions and even provide weekend trip plans. Users can customise My AI by giving it a nickname and indicating likes and dislikes.

### Methodology:

To evaluate the capabilities of the AI chatbot and assess its susceptibility to confusion, we interacted with the bot on the SnapChat. We tested the bot's responses to different types of questions, requests, and scenarios, aiming to uncover any potential weaknesses or areas where the bot might exhibit confusion.

### Findings:

During my experimentation, I discovered several instances where the SnapChat bot exhibited signs of confusion. The following factors contributed to its confusion:

- a) Asking the same questions over and over again: This indicate its inability to handle really conversations.

- b) Lack of Contextual Understanding: It was clear that the bot had trouble grasping the conversation's context. It produced responses that were either irrelevant or erroneous since it was unable to understand references made in previous chats or the underlying meaning of some questions.

- c) Limited Knowledge on abbreviation: the bot have limited knowledge on using abbreviation, which is mostly use by the youth in this generation and are the ones using snapChat.

### Confusing the Telegram Bot:

In my attempt to confuse the SnapChat bot, I deliberately crafted queries that deviated from our previous conversation and asked if we could chat in a different language. I observed that the bot was susceptible to confusion when faced with the following techniques:

- a) Semantic Contradictions: I used statements with semantic contradictions or paradoxes to test the bot's ability to reconcile contradictory facts. The bot frequently responded with generic phrases or failed to respond coherently.

- b) Non-sequitur Statements: Injecting non-sequitur statements or other issues into the conversation led in the bot producing irrelevant or nonsensical answers, showing the bot's susceptibility to misunderstanding.


### Conclusion:

The SnapChat bot is vulnerable to confusion and this can rise so many issues, including ambiguity in user input, inadequate contextual comprehension, knowledge gaps, and natural language processing problems. Understanding these constraints allows engineers to tweak and improve the Snapchat bot to give more accurate and effective support, resulting in more user happiness and engagement.
